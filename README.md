# thetraveler
A theme for oh-my-zsh inspired by theunraveler

## Installation
Install by adding to your local custom folder for oh-my-zsh (e.g. ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/)

# v1.1.0
## Inspired by theunraveler
I enjoyed the simple color scheme and approach to working directory status by theunraveler theme; however, I wanted to make the icons more meaningful to me (by making them more similar to each other). I also wanted to consolidate the git information with the current directory because I think this is valuable information (almost more than the current directory itself); when I moved the symbols to the left, I decided to pad them so the prompt is not constantly moving left and right as more work is done in the directory.

## Features
- The git information with the current directory on the left
- The symbols are uniform and large (increased visibility without overlapping)
- The prompt is padded for uniform distributed no matter the working directory status
- Outside a git repository, the padding is removed to reduce wasted space

## Future
- You are welcome to use this theme, fork the repo, and suggest new features
- Currently considering using emojis for the symbols, but I think there should always be a fallback to the simple unicode symbols to avoid a potentially cartoonish appearance
- Will be looking for performance improvements (if you see anything to improve, definitely suggest/fix it!)
